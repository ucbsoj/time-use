It was not until her early thirties that she began Annie who currently lives in Berkeley now spends her time working 40 hours a week while she spends around 30 hours with her family. But this was not always the case.</p> <p>According to her, she used to work 40-60 hours a week on average during her twenties and thirties. Over time, she embraced solitude and personal growth, finding balance through meditation, volunteering, and time with her close-knit family and community. While she once envisioned a more traditional path, her experiences shaped a life centered on independence, self-reflection, and meaningful connection. Looking ahead, she imagines a peaceful future surrounded by nature, possibly working with animals or giving back through therapeutic and volunteer work.</p> <p>“But I think I realized like over time that yes, like in my thirties, I was increasingly spending more and more time alone you know, just by choice or by default. But that’s also been a comfort of being alone.

She graduated in 1956 with a journalism degree from University of Illinois, choosing the field as a practical way to make a living through writing. In her early 20s, she worked reporting jobs in Boston and Chicago and establishing herself in her career.</p> <p>“And although I was married I didn’t plan to have children right away. It was somewhere in the future but in fact because of that I think I got a divorce from a very nice person,” she said.</p> <p>After returning to Chicago, she married and later divorced her first husband. By 1966, at age 30, she moved to New York with her second husband and photojournalist Ted Streshinsky, whom she married that year. Together, they built careers as freelancers—Shirley writing for national magazines and Ted covering international photo assignments. She became a mother at 32, with the birth of her son Mark in 1967, followed by her daughter Maria in 1969.</p> <p>Throughout her 30s and 40s, she balanced her work as a writer with raising her children. She and Ted managed their schedules so one parent was always home, especially in the early years. As her children grew older, she shifted into travel journalism in her late 40s and 50s, writing for outlets like The San Francisco Chronicle, Los Angeles Times and others. This allowed her to travel widely while continuing her professional writing career.</p> <p>Throughout her 30s and 40s, she balanced her work as a writer with raising her children.

I do think stereotypes do give you some information and we know that women spend more time with kids and the divorce rate has increased and women live longer than men, so that over time women are spending more time alone sort of seems baked into those patterns."</p>
